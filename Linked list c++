Dynamic Memory:
In C++, dynamic memory allocation allows memory to be allocated or deallocated during the execution of a program. The following functions are used to manage dynamic memory:

new: It is used to allocate memory dynamically and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.
delete: It is used to deallocate the memory that was previously allocated using new.
For example, consider the following code snippet:

int* dynamicIntArray = new int[10];

This code dynamically allocates memory for an array of 10 integers.

Linked List in C++ Classes:
A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object and each object is linked via references to the next element in the sequence. In C++, we can represent a linked list using a class.

Here's an example of a linked list class in C++:

class Node {
public:
    int data;
    Node* next;
};

class LinkedList {
public:
    Node* head;

    LinkedList() {
        head = nullptr;
    }

    void addNode(int value) {
        Node* newNode = new Node();
        newNode->data = value;
        newNode->next = nullptr;

        if (head == nullptr) {
            head = newNode;
        } else {
            Node* currentNode = head;
            while (currentNode->next != nullptr) {
                currentNode = currentNode->next;
            }
            currentNode->next = newNode;
        }
    }

    void printList() {
        Node* currentNode = head;
        while (currentNode != nullptr) {
            cout << currentNode->data << " ";
            currentNode = currentNode->next;
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
};

In this code, we define a Node class that represents an element in the linked list. Each Node object has an integer value and a pointer to the next Node object in the list.

The LinkedList class contains a head pointer to the first Node object in the list and methods to add a new Node to the list and print the entire list.
